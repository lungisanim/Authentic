So no corporate speak

The purpose of this project is to help people identify authentic identity numbers (ID) in South Africa, why?
Well if you're a student, especially one that's going to be renting a place its easy to be taken advantage of.

In fact the reason i started all this is because someone asked me to help verify if the person who gave them an
ID number was not lying to them, after endless hours not finding anything useful, i thought hey, i'm going to build it,
something for good.

If you can you can contribute to this project, it's open source for all purposes.

Mhhh, the Invalid class is invalid, how ironic.
